# Group6
Group project - Beau Barber, Rafael Gonzalez, Jadelyn Stewart, and Katherine Vande Pol
Analysis of the changes in temperature and rainfall, reported in five cities across Australia, during the years of 2008 to 2018, as well as an extended analysis of Sidney and Perth (cities on the opposite sides of the continent) over the years of 1970 to 2018. Effects of city, month, and year will be evaluated singly and in various combinations for temperature (maximum and minimum) and rainfall.
